          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
		  <p>In Conclusion, doing the heuristic evaluation and getting people to playtest and fill in a survey, helped a lot in doing HCI research and finding new ways to improve on a game component. </p>
		  <br>
		  <p>It also really helped to do the heuristic evaluation first to then use the results of it to aide in creating the survey, creating question based on the answers I got.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>If I were to do HCI research again (which I most probably will be) I would aim to get more data overall, get more specialists to do the heuristic evaluation and get a lot more people from a wider range to playtest and fill in the survey for more accurate data.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>I would also look at doing different research methods such as A/B testing and Task analysis, and I would try and do multiple passes, once a game component for example has been tested and improved I would reevaluate and get people to playtest it again to see if the results have improved.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>Overall this project has been helpful and I have learned a lot from it and I feel like I now know how to get good ways to playtest features for my next games and get good and accurate results to help support and improve my work.</p>
