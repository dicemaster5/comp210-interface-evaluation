			<p>Overall I got some great feedback in understanding where my controller did well and where it failed.
			<br>
			<h3>Where it went well:</h3>
			<p>My Custom Controller overall perfectly performed it’s intended task, being more fun to use than normal keyboard controls. With 100% of the playtesters saying it was more fun to use than the keyboard controls and 91.6% of playtesters finding it very fun to use.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Playtesters also thought that it felt intuitive to use with 87.5% of users saying it was very intuitive, and 83.3% of users said that the look of the controller added to the immersion of the game.</p>
			<br>
			<p>And 91.6% of users said that they would be interested in using a similar custom controller with a finished game.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
			<h3>Where it needs  improvement:</h3>
			<p>Only 64.6% of users felt that the Controller felt ergonomically good in the user’s hands, which isn’t terrible but could be much better if the controller’s shape had been better designed, and I do feel as that I could of made it much better.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Ways in which the controller could feel better to hold is by making it slightly larger so it fits a better range of hand sizes, and to potentially use softer materials or having padding spots on the wings where it is usually held by most users. These changes could drastically increase user’s comfort when handling the controller.</p>
			<br>
			<p>70.8% of playtesters thought that the feedback of the controller was satisfying, that initially doesn’t seem to bad, but missing about 30% of play testers not finding it fully satisfying isn’t great, for it to be as fun as possible to use, controller feedback should be a very high priority and therefore it need more work on improving the way it controls the in game spaceship.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Some of the ways this could be done is by increasing the ingame spaceship’s speed by the amount the custom controller is tilted, this was a feature that was suggested to me by a specialist who did my heuristics evaluation and some of the playtesters in the final question.</p>
