          <h2>Results for the Heuristic Evaluation:</h2>
		  
			The main points that were brought up from the 3 specialists that did my heuristic evaluation was:
			<ul>
				<li>Overall the controller felt intuitive to hold and control</li>
				<li>Controller still look very rough, would look nicer if it was coloured and more polished</li>
				<li>1 specialist suggested it could be wireless</li>
				<li>In game spaceship should accelerate depending on how much the physical controller is tilted, for better control of the speed of the in game spaceship</li>
				<li>1 specialist would of like to hold the controller as if it was a model toy plane/spaceship, like the way you hold a paper plane to feel more immersed when moving the spaceship.</li>
			</ul>

          <h2>Results for the Survey:</h2>
		  
			<p>The survey had a total of 9 questions to answer, 8 of them being Quantitative questions for solid data and the last one being a Qualitative question to get the opinion of the play tester.
			<br>
			<p>I got a total of 12 playtesters to fill in the survey.
			<br>
			<h3>Results for each question/section:</h3>

			<br>
			<p>I decided to make my first question about the playtester, to see if they were gamers and knew how most games usually play out to see if there was a correlation between someone who played games before felt the controller was more intuitive than someone who hadn’t played many video games before.
			<br>
			<p>Unfortunately I only got the time to ask people from the games Academy to play test meaning that 100% of my play testers were gamers and were familiar with playing video games.
			<br>
			<p>Probably the most important question, which got some very positive results.
			<p>This question was asked to see if the playtesters actually enjoyed the use of the controller.
			<p>From the results you can see that the majority of users found the experience enjoyable.
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>This question was asked to see how intuitive the control felt to the playtesters.
			<p>A majority felt that it was very intuitive, but 1 out of the 12 playtesters answered with a 2 on the likert scale so they felt that it wasn’t very intuitive which is interesting.
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>This question was asked to see if feedback of the controller felt satisfying, as in if the actions done with the controller were being conveyed properly in the game. 
			<p>This question might of needed to be worded in a better way as I’m not sure if all the playtesters understood what it meant.
			<br>
			<p>Overall the results are positive but 3 people fell in the middle and 1 person felt negative about it.
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>The results of this question say a lot about the design of the controller and shows that it really needs to be improved to make it feel better fo user to hold. The majority of the results fall on point 3 and 4 of the likert scale, showing that the controller was not the most ergonomically well designed for users to hold.
			<br>
			<p>This question got some very positive results, with the majority of playtesters feeling that the way the controller looked did in fact help them feel immersed in the gameplay.
			<p>These results are very reassuring as the whole point of the project was to create a more immersive experience by physically holding the smaller spaceship then it is to use keyboard controls.
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>This question was asked to see if players would of actually wanted to play a finished game with this custom controller or something similar to it. The results of this are very positive and potentially point to niche market of games that are controlled with custom controllers in the form of the character or vehicle that you control in game.
			<br>
			<p>This question was asked in order to see if any playtesters actually felt the keyboard controls felt more fun to play with. I didn’t think there would be anyone who thought that keyboard controls would of been more fun to use, but it would've been interesting to see why if there had been.
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>And the final Qualitative question being “Do you think the controller could be improved, if so, how?” in which the main answers to note where:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The shape of it needs improvement (it was sharp, too small and not enough grip )</li>
				<li>More sensitivity for controlling the ingame spaceship when titling the custom controller</li>
				<li>Different ways to hold the controller would be good</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These were some good informal feedback given for this question, a lot of the answers backed up the answers given for the heuristic evaluation given by the specialists.
